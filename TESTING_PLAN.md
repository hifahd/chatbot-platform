### Non-Functional Requirements
1. **Scalability** - Multiple users and projects concurrently
2. **Security** - Protect user data and authentication flows
3. **Extensibility** - Design allows future additions

4. [ ] Upload file to project
5. [ ] Start chat conversation
6. [ ] Send multiple messages
7. [ ] Verify AI responses reflect system prompt
8. [ ] Verify conversation persistence
9. [ ] Create second project
10. [ ] Switch between projects
